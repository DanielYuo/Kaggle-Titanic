## Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

Kaggle competition based on the sinking of Titanic which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). In this challenge, we were tasked to predict the survival of passengers in RMS Titanic using machine learning and data science. 

I based my notebook from an article found in medium.com by Niklas Donges titled, [Predicting the Survival of Titanic Passengers](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-the-survival-of-titanic-passengers-30870ccc7e8). Prediction model used in the final prediction was Random Forest Classifier after some data processing and feature engineering have been done.
